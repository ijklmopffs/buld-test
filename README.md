## Setup Instructions

To get this app running on your computer, simply clone the folder to your machine. Then you change directory into the folder and type in the `npm install` command. When the `node_modules` folder s down installing, type in the `npm run dev` command.

### Decisions

To ensure reusability, and maintain clean code, I split up the different sections of the app into its own component. This made it much easier to implement responsivity, and also future changes to the codebase would be made very easy. I also used the `useState` hook to manage the toggling of the navbar, ensuring a smooth transition between each state of `true` and `false`.

#### Technologies Used

- React - Frontend library for building UI Components
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- React Hooks (useState) - State management within functional components.

#### Time Spent

I spent a total of 8 hours and 30 minutes building this web application, between 5pm 6/03/2025 and 1:30am 7/03/2025.
